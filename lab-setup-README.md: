## 🧪 Example Scenario Template

Each scenario folder should contain:

- what is being observed or measured
- how to reproduce it
- expected outcome

## 🔐 Safety & Legal Use

This lab is for:
- systems you own
- systems you have explicit permission to test
- simulated environments only

Do not use this lab to interfere with real aircraft or real airspace.

## 📌 Next Steps

1. Create your first SITL scenario folder
2. Add startup scripts
3. Capture baseline logs
4. Connect detection rules and policies from the main repository

This lab folder is the foundation for all defensive research in this project.
