Yes — for a drone security / defensive research repo like yours, a few extra folders are very useful and keep the project professional and scalable.

Since you’re already organizing around PX4 + ArduPilot, I recommend adding these on top of what you already created.

(Your existing structure is already good.)

Below are the best-practice additions for your use-case.


---

✅ Recommended extra folders

1️⃣ lab-setup/

For your repeatable security lab environment.

Use it for:

SITL setup

network topology

container / VM notes

tooling install scripts


lab-setup/

This is very useful when working with
PX4
and
ArduPilot.


---

2️⃣ datasets/

For logs and captured telemetry used in analysis.

datasets/

Examples:

pcaps

mavlink logs

RF captures

anomaly samples


⚠️ You can add a .gitkeep file and keep large files out of GitHub later.


---

3️⃣ detection-rules/

Very important for your defensive focus.

detection-rules/

Use it for:

detection heuristics

anomaly rules

behavior signatures

IDS-style rules for drone links



---

4️⃣ policies/

Since you already talked before about drone rules and policy engines, this fits your roadmap perfectly.

policies/

Use it for:

flight policy definitions

geofence logic

safety constraints

mission validation rules



---

5️⃣ scripts/

Lightweight helper scripts should not live in tools/.

scripts/

Use it for:

setup scripts

log converters

replay tools

automation helpers



---

6️⃣ reports/

For real research output.

reports/

Use it for:

test results

experiments

comparisons

security assessments



---

✅ Your improved structure (clean & practical)

Here is a clean layout that fits your repo perfectly:

drone-hacking/
├─ docs/
│  ├─ threat-models/
│  ├─ protocols/
│  └─ lab-guides/
│
├─ lab-setup/
├─ datasets/
├─ detection-rules/
├─ policies/
│
├─ px4-security/
├─ ardupilot-security/
│
├─ tools/
├─ scripts/
├─ simulations/
└─ reports/


---

🎯 Why this structure works well for you

Because your project is:

not just tools

not just exploits

but a defensive drone security lab


This layout cleanly separates:

platform research

lab infrastructure

detection & policy work

real results


Which makes your repo look like a real research project — not a random “hacking” repo.


---

✅ One-command to add the new folders

From inside drone-hacking:

mkdir -p lab-setup datasets detection-rules policies scripts reports


---

If you want, next I can generate a small lab-setup/README.md template so your lab becomes reproducible from day one.
