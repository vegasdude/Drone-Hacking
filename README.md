# Drone Hacking
### Defensive Security & Safety Research for UAV Systems

This repository focuses on **ethical, defensive, and educational security research** for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and drone platforms.

The goal is to help developers, researchers, and operators better understand real-world attack surfaces and improve the resilience, safety, and reliability of drone systems.

## 🎯 Project Scope

This project covers:

- Drone communication security (telemetry, command & control)
- Ground control station (GCS) security testing
- Firmware and protocol analysis
- Threat modeling for UAV systems
- Secure deployment and configuration practices
- Detection, logging, and monitoring of abnormal drone behavior

---

## 🔬 Research Platforms

This repository includes (or plans to include) defensive research and testing for:

- PX4-based flight stacks
- ArduPilot-based systems
- Software-in-the-loop (SITL) and hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) labs
- Companion computers (Linux / SBCs such as Raspberry Pi)

---

## 🧪 Drone Security Lab

This repo is designed to become a practical **drone security lab** with:

- Reproducible test scenarios
- Simulated attack paths
- Logging and analysis tools
- Rule and policy validation for drone operations

---

## 🛡️ Ethical & Legal Notice

This repository is intended **only for educational, defensive, and research purposes**.

Do NOT use any material in this project to:
- attack real systems without permission
- interfere with real aircraft or airspace
- violate laws or safety regulations

Always test in controlled environments and with systems you own or have explicit permission to use.
